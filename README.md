# RoboMirror

RoboMirror's aim is to provide a very simple and user-centered GUI for Robocopy to allow for easy synchronization of two directory trees, e.g., to perform a robust incremental backup, both locally (e.g., to an external hard disk) and across the network.

Additionally, RoboMirror supports volume shadow copies. By using shadow copies, all files can be copied, including files locked by running processes (Outlook, SQL Server...).
