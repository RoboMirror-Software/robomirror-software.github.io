<h1>RoboMirror</h1>

<p>RoboMirror is a GUI front-end for the quite popular <code>Robocopy.exe</code> command-line
utility for Windows.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Robocopy</strong> is shipped with Windows since Vista and available as free SDK tool for
previous Windows versions (RoboMirror already includes it).<br>
It allows to robustly synchronize two directory trees, both locally
and across the network. It is therefore often used for mirroring purposes,
e.g., as a powerful yet free backup utility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>RoboMirror</strong>'s aim is to make Robocopy more accessible by providing a very
simple and user-centered GUI, because most users simply don't want to
work directly with the console or are overwhelmed by Robocopy's flexibility.</p>

<p>Additionally, RoboMirror supports <strong>volume shadow copies</strong>. This allows to copy files
locked by running processes (Outlook, SQL Server...).</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Very simple graphical interface</strong></p>

<p>Simplicity was one of the primary goals as I started coding this little
application when my mum asked me for a simple backup tool. I was not
able to find something I was looking for, so I started this project with
the aim to be as simple as possible while still providing for what
most users need, e.g., performing backups of folders to external hard
drives or network shares, synchronizing an MP3 player with the music
folder etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Managing mirror tasks</strong></p>

<p>RoboMirror is based on a set of mirror tasks. A mirror task consists in
a source folder and a target folder.</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot" src="img/TaskDialog.png" style="max-width:100%;"></p>

<p>When performing a backup, new and modified files &amp; folders in the
source folder will be copied to the target folder.<br>
When performing a restore operation, the operation is reversed by swapping
source and target folders, i.e., new and differing files &amp; folders in
the target folder will be copied to the source folder.</p>

<p>The <code>Overwrite newer files</code> option controls whether newer files
in the target (<em>restore operation</em>: source) folder are to be overwritten by
older ones from the source (<em>restore operation</em>: target) folder.

<p>Files &amp; folders which exist in the target (<em>restore operation</em>: source)
folder but not in the source (<em>restore operation</em>: target) folder, so-called
<strong>extra files &amp; folders</strong>, can optionally be deleted to create an identical mirror.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Two-way synchronization</strong></p>

<p>Performing a two-way synchronization is admittedly a bit clumsy, but oversimplifying it can easily result in bad surprises.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario</strong>: Both folders are to contain <strong>all files</strong> and the latest version of each file.</p>

    <ol>
    <li>Make sure to disable both <code>Overwrite newer files</code> and
    <code>Delete extra files and folders</code> options for the desired task.</li>
    <li>Perform a <strong>backup</strong> operation. This will copy all new and newer files &amp; folders from the
    source folder to the target folder.</li>
    <li>Then perform a <strong>restore</strong> operation. This will copy all new and newer files &amp; folders from the
    target folder to the source folder.</li>
    </ol>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Extended NTFS attributes</strong></p>

<p>Besides copying file data, attributes and time stamps, RoboMirror can also
copy extended NTFS attributes, either only the access control lists (ACLs) or
everything (ACLs, owner and auditing information).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Excluding files &amp; folders</strong></p>

<p>Entire subfolders, files and wildcards in the source (<em>restore operation</em>: target)
folder may be excluded from synchronization.<br>
Additionally, files may be excluded by any of the common attributes (Hidden, System and Encrypted).</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot" src="img/ExcludedItemsDialog.png" style="max-width:100%;"></p>

<p>A wildcard excludes all matching items in the source (<em>restore operation</em>: target)
folder <strong>and in all of its subfolders</strong>!<br>
Due to Robocopy limitations, wildcards cannot include any path information, e.g., <code>\MySubfolder\*.bak</code> is
not a valid wildcard.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simulation run</strong> to identify the pending changes which are then presented
to the user, asking for confirmation. This should prevent unpleasant
surprises. ;)</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot" src="img/Preview.png" style="max-width:100%;"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scheduling backups</strong></p>

<p>Backup tasks may be scheduled on a regular basis (daily, weekly and
monthly at a given time).</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot" src="img/ScheduleTaskDialog.png" style="max-width:100%;"></p>

<p>Scheduled RoboMirror tasks require an interactive session, so the user needs to be
logged on. The tasks are scheduled such that they are executed automatically as soon as possible if
a scheduled start has been missed (e.g., because the machine was powered off or the user
wasn't logged on).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: If a backup task is scheduled via RoboMirror running as administrator,
the scheduled task will be executed as administrator and not cause any UAC prompt!</p>
</blockquote>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logging and task history</strong></p>

<p>All manually started and scheduled operations are logged, including the
full Robocopy output. The complete history of a mirror task may be
displayed for further analysis.</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot" src="img/History.png" style="max-width:100%;"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Volume shadow copies</strong></p>

<p>By creating a temporary shadow copy of the source (<em>restore operation</em>: target)
volume and copying from that shadow copy, all files can be copied, including files locked by
running processes (e.g., Outlook locking its <code>.pst</code> files, SQL server its
databases).</p>

<p>This is accomplished using the handy <a href="http://alphavss.codeplex.com/">AlphaVSS</a> open-source library.
A non-persistent shadow copy snapshot (a.k.a. <em>System Restore point</em>) of the source
(<em>restore operation</em>: target) volume will be created and mounted as network share.
As soon as the mirror operation is finished, the shadow copy is deleted.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features requiring elevated privileges</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Volume shadow copy</strong> to copy files locked by running processes</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Robocopy backup mode</strong> <code>/zb</code> or <code>/b</code> to copy files the user has no direct access to</p></li>
<li><p>Copying extended <strong>NTFS owner and auditing information</strong> <code>/copyall</code> or <code>/copy:datsou</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>In order to use these features, the user needs to be in the <code>Backup Operators</code>
or in the <code>Administrators</code> group. In the latter case, Robomirror needs
to be run as administrator if using Windows Vista or newer and UAC is enabled.</p>

<h2>Which basic Robocopy switches are used?</h2>

<pre><code>/z[b] /e /fft /r:12 /w:5 /tbd /np
</code></pre>

<p>Use Robocopy restartable mode (with backup mode fallback on access denied errors if RoboMirror runs with the required privileges),
include empty folders, assume FAT file times (2-second granularity),
12 retry attempts with 5 seconds delay, wait for network shares to be defined,
no detailed progress output.</p>

<p>You may modify the default switches to your liking by editing the file <code>RoboMirror.exe.config</code>
in the application directory (e.g., <code>C:\Program Files\RoboMirror\RoboMirror.exe.config</code>). It is an
XML file, open it with your favourite text editor.</p>

<p>In that file you may also disable the simulation run if you feel confident
and want to save some seconds and a mouse click when performing a backup.</p>
